## üí¨ About the Application

The Recipe-Sharing-API is a RESTful API developed as part of a group performance test. It is designed for managing and sharing recipes, integrating with MongoDB for data storage.

## üåü Features

### Recipe Management
- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations**: Users can add new recipes, view existing recipes, update them, or delete them as needed.
### Advanced Search Capabilities
- **Tag-based Search**: Allows users to find recipes based on specific tags (e.g., Vegan, Gluten-free), making it easier to discover recipes that meet their dietary preferences.
- **Ingredients-based Search**: Enables searching for recipes by ingredients. Users can find recipes that use specific ingredients they have or want to use.
### User Experience
- **Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling throughout the API to provide clear feedback to the client, ensuring a smooth user experience even when things go wrong.
- **Environment Variable Support**: Configuration options like server port and database URI are set via environment variables, offering flexibility and security for deployment.
### Security and Performance
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that all user inputs are validated before processing to prevent invalid data from affecting the system.
- **Efficient Data Modeling**: Utilizes Mongoose for efficient data modeling and interaction with MongoDB, ensuring fast and reliable data access.
### Developer Experience
- **Clear Documentation**: Provides detailed API documentation, making it easy for developers to understand and use the API.
- **Development Tools**: Includes tools like nodemon for automatic server restarts during development, enhancing the developer workflow.
### Database Integration
- **MongoDB Integration**: Seamlessly connects to MongoDB using Mongoose for object data modeling, providing a robust and scalable database solution.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this API is to provide a platform for users to share and manage recipes, including features like searching recipes by ingredients or tags. It is designed to be simple and efficient, allowing users to quickly find the recipes they need.

# ‚ö° Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to set up the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReginioMarkGilbert/Recipe-Sharing-API.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure .env file with your PORT and MONGODB_URI.

4. **Start the Server**: Use npm start for production or npm run dev for development with nodemon.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start, and you should see a message like <span style="color:green"><strong>Server is running on port 3000</strong></span> in your terminal.

5. **Test the Application**: You can now test the application by sending requests to <span style="color:green"><strong>http://localhost:3000/api/recipes</strong></span>. You can use a tool like Postman or Insomnia to send HTTP requests.
